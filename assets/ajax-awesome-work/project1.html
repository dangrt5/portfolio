          Happy Camper is a camp site assistance tool that allows the user to look up nearby area camp sites within 50 miles of that searched location. The camp sites will display information regarding address, phone number, amenities offered, 16-day weather of that location, and a Google Map view of the area. Most importantly, users can also save information about specific camp sites for offline usage with the assistance of Service Workers. </div>
