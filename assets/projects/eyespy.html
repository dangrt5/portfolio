            Eye Spy is a scavenger hunt game that has the user upload an image based off the clues given from an AI called Clarifai. This AI is used to analyze both the uploaded image and the random image that is pulled from Flickr and gives back several descriptions about the pictures. The player is scored based off how similar the image they uploaded is to the Flickr photo.
