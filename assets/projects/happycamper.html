      Happy Camper is a camp site assistance tool that allows the user to look
      up nearby area camp sites within 50 miles of that searched location. The
      camp sites will display information regarding address, phone number,
      amenities offered, 16-day weather of that location, and a Google Map view
      of the area. Most importantly, users can also save information about
      specific camp sites for offline usage with the assistance of Service
      Workers.

      planning of feature sets and wireframing of the user interface allowed
      easier transitions to creating the layout skeletons and design. The
      client-side was developed with React, and Redux. The backend was developed
      with PHP with a MySQL database.
